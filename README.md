Game Information:
Location: Abandoned Asylum Building 

Character: Streamer (1st Person from the live stream point of view)

Movement: Character moving on their own, but can rotate the camera with the weapon (mouse movement)

GameStory/Gameplay:
Drives up to the asylum (cut scene) and the streamer gets out of the car. In the car he explains backstory - looking for a lost object/artefact. 

Character messing around until starting to hear creepy noises+instruction on the screen for him to turn around. Another shadow on the floor next to his shadow and chat starts telling him to turn around. 

Once he turns, he sees a face and starts running through the building. That is when he starts encountering obstacles and asking the chat what to do. Timer for the player to choose an option in the multiple choice given. Depending on the option, the streamer either progresses or gets caught.

If the character successfully goes through the chase, he ends up in the room with the object he is searching for, but right as he grabs it, his battery starts running out and he starts hearing creepy noises and the screen shows end of stream sign.

It cuts to the streamer in his room with the object, but as he goes to explore it, mist comes out of it and his voice starts getting distorted + starts coughing.

(Note: Seeing a face when turning all the way around, creepy messing around scenes at the beginning, voice similar to animal crossing)
